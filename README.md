### Statement of purpose

Ride sharing services such as Uber are becoming increasingly popular. Though convenient, these services can be expensive when taken at the wrong times. Our objective is to analyze UberPool and UberX prices between two fixed locations to determine the best time to take an Uber. We also analyze both UberPool and UberX data to determine which type of Uber is the most economical for particular time intervals.
